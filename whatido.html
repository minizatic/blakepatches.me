		<h2>My Life's Work (So Far)</h2>
		<div class="third">
			<h3>Design</h3>
			<p>I design elegant and minimalistic websites for the modern internet, designed to stand out among the sea of clutter. They are created to be fluid, easy to use, and to give a great experience no matter what device you happen to be using.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="third">
			<h3>Programming</h3>
			<p>I also create performant and interactive web applications that go hand-in-hand with my designs. They are designed to be fast, as well as scalable for user bases of any size. You are not limited to things that have been done before, either. If you can dream it up, I can create it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="third">
			<h3>Domains and Hosting</h3>
			<p>You'll also need somewhere to host your website, as well as a catchy domain name so that people can find it. I take care of all this for you, so don't worry about it. It doesn't matter if you are an individual just looking to put your name out there, or a multinational corporation, I'll take care of it.</p>
